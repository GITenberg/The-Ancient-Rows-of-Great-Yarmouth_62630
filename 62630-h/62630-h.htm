</a><span class="smcap">The</span> two most remarkable and
noteworthy features of the ancient Borough of Great Yarmouth,
that remain unchanged to the present day, are the Parish Church,
and the unique series of long, narrow passages, known by the
general name of Rows.&nbsp; The wonderful proportions and
interesting features of the renowned Church having been duly
examined, these singularly confined thoroughfares next claim the
attention of the intelligent visitor.&nbsp; On seeing them for
the first time, the query naturally arises in the mind, why were
they constructed in this peculiar manner, so opposed to all
prevailing ideas?&nbsp; Thoughtful minds have ingeniously
surmised sundry motives; but the preponderating belief is
probably the most correct one, viz., the builders&rsquo; desire
to economise the limited area at their disposal within the walls
of the fortifications.&nbsp; In early times the population of
Yarmouth grew apace; numbers of enterprising persons from various
places being attracted thither by the flourishing fishing
operations that were carried on here.&nbsp; Manship, in his
History of Yarmouth, states that within four hundred years from
the time when &ldquo;from a sand in the sea, by the deflection of
the tides, Yarmouth grew dry and firm land, whereby it became
habitable; the population grew to a great multitude, over whom,
at the beginning of the Reign of Henry I., a Provost was
appointed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be mentioned, by the way, that it
was in this reign the Parish Church of St. Nicholas was
built.&nbsp; The population of Yarmouth, in the year 1348,
numbered ten thousand.&nbsp; We can, therefore, without
difficulty, understand how valuable space would be in those early
times, and how general the desire to make the most of it.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>It is
interesting to notice that Manship, who wrote in the year 1619,
opined a very different reason for the circumscribed limits of
the Rows.&nbsp; When contemplating them patriotically, he
prognosticated, with glowing satisfaction, the bad half-hour that
awaited any rash invader, who might incontinently venture to
approach them, feeling assured the brave and hardy inhabitants
&ldquo;of those seven score passes&rdquo; would render a good
account of themselves on any such occasion. <a
name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a>&nbsp; But we must quote his own
words.&nbsp; He says: &ldquo;The number of them (&lsquo;the
Rows&rsquo;) at this day be 140; whereby every householder to his
private dwelling hath of all necessaries very convenient
conveyance, and the same in time of hostility, for the defence
and safeguard of the town, is very meet and necessary, for one
man against twenty, with shot and powder, is able to make
resistance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Continuing the subject, he says:
&ldquo;These buildings, although dissevered and disjoined each
from the other by Rowes or Lanes, the same being in number, as I
have before declared, one hundred and forty, yet is there not any
more division in comeliness, to be by the eye discovered, amongst
them, than unpleasantness to the ear in music, consisting of many
discords which do make a perfect concord.&nbsp; The streets being
contrived and built in such warlike manner, flankerwise, with
such convenient distance from the walls (fortifications)
aforesaid, that the enemy having gained the walls, and entered
the town (both which God forbid), may with few men, be enforced
to retire, and the town recovered without any great danger
sustained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems the most reasonable supposition that the Rows were
constructed as we see them, in order that as large a population
as possible might be concentrated within the narrowest limits, to
make the work of <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>fortifying the town as easy a matter as possible, and
give, at the same time, greater security to the whole.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p5b.jpg">
<img class='floatright' alt=
"A Yarmouth Row"
title=
"A Yarmouth Row"
 src="images/p5s.jpg" />
</a>The following imaginative idea may be taken for what it is
worth, namely, that the ground plan of the Streets and Rows were
suggested by the fishermen&rsquo;s nets, when spread out in long
lines upon the Denes for drying, a narrow pathway being left
between the nets of each fisherman, the pathways representing the
Rows.</p>
<p>It has been sagely remarked by a reflective writer that the
Rows &ldquo;seem to have been so constructed, that in the event
of an unusually high tide, the water might flow through
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in like manner observes another, &ldquo;if
the water swept over on one side, it would make its escape at the
other as if through a grating.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had such a
contingency <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>been in contemplation, surely a greater breadth would
have been given to allow the water a freer flow.</p>
<p>These Rows, as might have been anticipated, have been objects
of much interest to Visitors generally, but especially to those
of antiquarian tendencies.&nbsp; The minds of some have been so
impressed with their old-world appearance, that on returning to
their distant homes, they have relieved themselves by relating
wonderful descriptions of them to the unfortunate individuals who
had not yet seen them.&nbsp; Some have excitedly rushed into
print, and gladly made known to whole neighbourhoods, through
their local press, the striking phenomena they had witnessed
here.&nbsp; One described the Rows to wondering readers as
&ldquo;fearsome apertures in the street,&rdquo; and then
soothingly added, &ldquo;but there is nothing to
fear.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another, we imagine, well-versed in country
life, said they were &ldquo;like rabbit burrows.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
third descriptive writer asserted that &ldquo;many of the ancient
thoroughfares might be appropriately termed cracks in the wall,
they are so narrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another less excitable
individual wrote, &ldquo;many of them are so narrow that you can
easily touch both sides at once, by stretching out your hands
while walking through, and it surprises the stranger not a little
to be told that these were the only communications between the
principal thoroughfares of the town.&rdquo;&nbsp; The critical
pen of another scribe declares them to be &ldquo;very long
alleys&mdash;needless alleys I should say, if the architects had
only known what they were about in the days when these alleys
were made.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah! yes! and then, before leaving the
consideration of them, he thus describes their
capabilities.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are so narrow that neighbours can
shake hands across their little street.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another,
condescendingly, describes the way in which it may be done.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The inhabitants might lean out of their windows and shake
hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still further capabilities were seen by
another imaginative writer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can put your hand
out of your bedroom window and put out the candle in your
neighbour&rsquo;s;&rdquo; and, I suppose, if necessary, borrow
the candlestick; but this he omitted to state.&nbsp; One, whose
presence had, <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>doubtless graced continental cities, as well as honoured
the Rows of Great Yarmouth, saw in them other possibilities, and
stated &ldquo;for intricacies they can compete with the most
confined of those of any Continental City you can mention, where
the inhabitants can converse and shake hands from upper stories,
visit each other in night-caps, quarrel in the upper world, or
carry on a general confab, peacefully or otherwise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Somewhat more definitely wrote another: &ldquo;They are passages
between parallel streets, some with shops on either side like
Union Passage in Birmingham, but most of them only a few feet
wide, with dwelling houses on each side, where a jump from one
window to another would be an easy task for a
gymnast.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who can but admire the following graphic
description?&nbsp; &ldquo;What a quaint old town.&nbsp; The fine
Market Place is like an open plain; the scores of narrow
&lsquo;Rows&rsquo; running out of it may be likened to burrows
leading in all manner of directions.&nbsp; However does each
denizen find his, or her dwelling?&nbsp; Do they never get mixed,
and give it up for a bad job?&nbsp; Some of these Rows are too
narrow to permit of a man falling down if he got
crosswise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having investigated them with the eye of
an antiquary, another gentleman described the Rows as &ldquo;the
long series of narrow passages, running from one principal street
to another, numbering 145 in all, with houses on each side.&nbsp;
Although none of them are sufficiently wide to allow of other
than pedestrian traffic, many quaint old-fashioned houses, dating
several centuries back, bearing both external and internal
evidence of great expense and labour being devoted to their
erection and decoration.&nbsp; In fact, old Yarmouth is full of
interest to the antiquary and to the curiosity
seeker.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, the visitor with an eye to
sanitation, has not allowed the Rows to be unexplored.&nbsp; They
have borne the scrutiny, and we may breathe freely now the
verdict has been given.&nbsp; &ldquo;A remarkable appearance is
presented to the visitor by the number of long narrow lanes
called &lsquo;Rows&rsquo; that run east and west of the
town.&nbsp; It leaves little room for doubt of the healthiness of
the place when these Rows are examined, for their cleanliness and
orderly appearance must surely render them conducive to the
highest possible standard of health; and if these observations
can be applied with as much appropriateness to the internal
sanitary arrangements of the dwellings&mdash;as I have reason to
believe it may&mdash;the Corporation may congratulate themselves
on the success of their efforts in this respect.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>We will now present the reader with the observations of
writers who have less cursorily investigated this
wonderland.&nbsp; A writer in a metropolitan <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>newspaper gave
the following well-considered description:&mdash;&ldquo;These
openings are the famous Yarmouth &lsquo;Rows,&rsquo; 154 in
number, running parallel to each other, between the river and the
sea, and so narrow that the meanest London Lane would look a very
Regent Street if placed alongside of them.&nbsp; I measured one,
it was the narrowest I saw, and found, that at the entrance, it
was little more than two feet across.&nbsp; It is probably
reserved for thin natives, since no fat man, with all his clothes
on, could safely venture to tread it.&nbsp; In all points of
comparison, however, but narrowness, the Yarmouth Rows have a
decided advantage over the London Lanes, and it is this that
makes their appearance so extraordinary to a Londoner.&nbsp; He
naturally associates poverty, filth, squalor, and all sorts of
misery and crime with courts in which the inhabitants can shake
hands with each other out of the opposite windows, or step at one
stride across the so-called street or lane.&nbsp; Everyone with a
watch to lose, carefully shuns such localities, or instinctively
buttons up his coat if he happens to wander into them.&nbsp; At
night the narrow gloomy jaws of the Yarmouth Rows must, to a
cockney pilgrim of a lively imagination, look even <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>more
formidable; but in daylight, one glance down them suffices to
show that they are widely different from anything that his
experience had taught him to expect.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The model Row is respectability itself; its tiny toy
pavement of brick or stone is easily kept clean, and shines like
the deck of a man-of-war; the houses on each side, so far from
betraying any signs of squalor or painful poverty, are, some of
them, so nicely kept with rows of flower pots brightening the
windows, and clustering creepers draping the naked wall, that one
begins to wonder how people, who are in a position to consider
the amenities, as well as the necessaries of life, consent to
live in such close, crowded quarters, and is driven to conjure
that they are a jolly neighbourly race, who like, out of pure
good fellowship, to be always in talking and hand-shaking
distance of each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this theory that the grotesque construction of the
Yarmouth Rows is due not to strategic, but to social
considerations, is supported by the fact, in the &lsquo;good old
times,&rsquo; each Row took its name, in friendly fashion, from
the best-known or the principal person living in it.&nbsp; In
these degenerate days of scientific classification, arithmetic
has triumphed over flesh and blood, and each Row is known by its
number, with the single exception, I believe, of &lsquo;Kitty
Witches&rsquo; Row&rsquo;&mdash;once a pet preserve of the
invaluable public servant, the witch-finder Hopkins, who could
always count upon unearthing enough ugly women in Yarmouth, with
the unmistakeable witch marks on their sea-tanned shrivelled old
skins, to make a respectable official return, and satisfy
Government that public money was not being wasted.&nbsp; The Rows
are, I am told, chiefly the resort of the seafaring population,
who constitute Yarmouth&rsquo;s working class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A writer in <i>Cassell&rsquo;s Magazine</i> says: &ldquo;the
Rows are not wooden arcades like those of Chester, but straight
and extremely narrow alleys, running between the principal
streets and the river, like the rungs of a ladder, to the number
of 156.&nbsp; Now-a-days only the humbler class of people live
there, but having penetrated into a good many of them, I am bound
to say that in no instance have I seen the squalor and misery of
a low neighbourhood in London.&nbsp; There are vice and poverty
in Herring-haven, as elsewhere, but you see none of those sights
which saddens the heart of the reflective Londoner.&nbsp; I think
the filthy coal smoke has something to do with the degradation of
our metropolitan poor.&nbsp; Country folks who come and settle in
Babylon grow in time weary of contending with the blacks, and
suffer their children to grow up grimy and ragged, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>while the
children playing about the doors in the Rows are clean, healthy,
decently dressed, and civil spoken. * * * Whitewash is laid
liberally on every accessible place, the causeway is plentifully
supplied with gutters made of semi-circular yellow tiles, and in
no instance have I encountered those vile odours which offend you
on the Continent.&nbsp; It would be false to say that I never
smelt fish; there is a vast deal of shrimp boiling done in some
of these Rows, but of those filthy stenches of which Coleridge
numbered seventy-two in the city of Cologne, I detected not
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</i> of June, 1882, gave the
following interesting description:&mdash;&ldquo;At one time the
inhabitants of this old borough took up to living on a plan
almost entirely their own, and the Rows in which they built their
houses remain to this day the most curious of all the features of
the ancient town.&nbsp; The Rows are narrow streets leading to
and from the quay,&mdash;not narrow in the ordinary sense, but
narrower, perhaps, than any other streets in the world, their
average width being six feet.&nbsp; They are not isolated
infrequent lanes left between more commodious thoroughfares by
the incomplete modifications of early plans, but they form a
system and their aggregate length is about eight miles.&nbsp; Six
feet is their average width, but some of them are scarcely more
than three feet, and two persons cannot pass one another without
contracting themselves and painfully sidling in the opposite
directions.&nbsp; The pavement is of rough cobble-stones, with
sometimes a strip of flags down the middle to ease the way of the
pedestrian.&nbsp; The houses tower up with smooth perpendicular
walls, like cliffs, on both sides, and shut out the light, the
upper stories projecting in many cases beyond the lower, and
forming an arch over the narrow passage below.&nbsp; Most of
these houses are very old, and the material of which they are
built is flint or stone, often white-washed, though occasionally
left in its natural condition with open timbering in the fronts;
in one or two the masonry is of the herring-bone pattern; but
huddled up as they are, without regard to privacy or ventilation,
staring into one another&rsquo;s faces with undesirable intimacy,
they are of a good class, and in good condition, and some of them
have courtyards before them with nasturtiums and scarlet runners
dragging a tender green web over their white walls.&nbsp; The
narrowest of the Rows is only 2 feet 3 inches in width.&nbsp;
There are in all 156 of them, each known by its number.&nbsp; The
object of the frugal plan in which they originated is a
mystery.&nbsp; One of the guesses at it is this:&mdash;&lsquo;The
fishermen spread out their nets to dry very carefully, and leave
on the four sides of each net a <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>clear passage, four, five or six feet
wide.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is suggested that the ground on which the
Rows stand was once used for this purpose, and that the passages
became so well defined from constant traffic that eventually they
were perpetuated as streets.&nbsp; However this may be, it is
certain that some of the houses in the Rows were among the first
built in the town, and certain also that, leading from the main
street, they give easy access to the Quay, whereon Yarmouth finds
its chief interest.&nbsp; When the moon is full and throws black
beams of shadows across these alleys, and opens seeming pitfalls
in their rugged pavement, a stranger hesitates to enter
them.&nbsp; At all times they seem properly to belong to
conspirators, but they are quite safe and reputable.&nbsp; In
olden times the Watchmen patrolled them, &lsquo;crying the
wind&rsquo; for sleepless merchants and anxious skippers; and the
bellmen of the Church of St. Nicholas prayed in them for the
souls of those who had bequeathed money for the purpose. <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; The wind holds pretty well to one
quarter in Yarmouth, and it is said the watchmen seldom had
occasion to vary their announcement: &lsquo;East is the wind,
east-north-east; past two and a cloudy morning.&rsquo;</p>

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Having invented the narrowest streets in the world, the
inhabitants had to devise an original vehicle for their
locomotion, as no ordinary carts could enter them, and this
necessity was relieved by the &lsquo;trolly,&rsquo; a peculiar
cart about 12 feet long, with two wheels revolving on a box axle,
placed underneath the sledge, the extreme width of the vehicle
being about 3 feet 6 inches.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;Even in the dead of night the Rows are not quite
still.&nbsp; All of them lead toward the river, and some of them
reveal the black lines of clustered masts and rigging.&nbsp; Many
of the houses are occupied by fishermen, who are astir at all
hours.&nbsp; The shrimpers go out to meet the tide at eleven or
twelve o&rsquo;clock, and though the river has some traffic with
distant ports, the most frequent vessels on it are the
&lsquo;dandy-rigged&rsquo; boats and the rakish cutters which
belong to the great industry of the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Were we to omit the characteristic description given in
<i>Household Words</i>, Vol.&nbsp; VII., p. 163, that is very
generally ascribed to the pen of the late Charles Dickens, our
list of noteworthy quotations would be rightly deemed by many
readers to be very incomplete.&nbsp; We gladly insert the
following from that excellent magazine, heading the extract with
some lines from a rhyming description of Yarmouth, written by Mr.
H. J. Betts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the Rows! them long bars of the
gridiron,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Dickens hev wrote on&mdash;so quare;<br />
Them ere Rows are a great institution,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the town at the mouth of the Yare.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Great Yarmouth is one vast gridiron, of which the bars
are represented by &lsquo;Rows,&rsquo; to the number of one
hundred and fifty-six.&nbsp; Repel the recollection of a
Chester-row, a Paradise-row, or a Rotten-row.&nbsp; A Row is a
long, narrow lane or alley, quite straight, or as nearly as may
be, with houses on each side, both of which you can sometimes
touch at once with the finger tips of each hand, by stretching
out your arms to their full extent.&nbsp; Now and then the houses
overhang, and even join above your head, converting the Row, so
far, into a sort of tunnel or tubular passage.&nbsp; Many and
many picturesque old bit of domestic architecture is to be hunted
up among the Rows.&nbsp; In some Rows there is little more than a
blank wall for the double boundary.&nbsp; In others, the houses
retreat into tiny square courts, where washing and clear
starching are done, and wonderful nasturtiums and scarlet runners
are reared from green boxes, filled with that scarce commodity,
vegetable mould.&nbsp; Most of the Rows <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>are paved
with pebbles from the Beach, and, strange to say, these narrow
gangways are traversed by horses and carts which are built for
this special service, and which have been the cause of serious
misunderstanding among antiquaries, as to whether they were or
were not modelled after the chariots of Roman invaders.&nbsp; Of
course, if two carts were to meet in the middle of a Row, one of
the two must either go back to the end again, or pass over the
other one, like goats upon a single file ledge of a
precipice.&nbsp; The straightness of the passage usually obviates
this alternative.&nbsp; A few Rows are well paved throughout with
flagstones.&nbsp;

</a>&nbsp; Carts are not allowed to enter <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>these, and
foot passengers prefer them to the pebbly pathways.&nbsp; Hence
they are the chosen locality of numerous little
shopkeepers.&nbsp; If you want a stout pair of hob-nail shoes, or
a scientifically oiled dreadnought, or a dozen of bloaters, or a
quadrant or a compass, or a bunch of turnips, the best in the
world, or a woollen comforter and night-cop for one end of your
person, and worsted overall stockings for the other, or a plate
of cold boiled leg of pork stuffed with parsley, or a ready-made
waistcoat, with blazing pattern and bright glass
buttons&mdash;with any of these you can soon be accommodated in
one or other of the Paved Rows.&nbsp; Here you have a board
announcing the luxurious interval, during which hot joints are
offered to the satisfaction of salt water appetite; from twelve
to two no one need suffer hunger.&nbsp; Elsewhere is the notice
over the door, that within are &lsquo;<span class="GutSmall">LIVE
AND BOILED SHRIMPS SOLD BY THE CATCHER</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Shrimps, unadulterated, boiled and sold by the very catcher
himself,&mdash;the original article, and no mistake!&nbsp; From
time immemorial, there has been a Market Row, in which two people
<i>can</i> walk arm-in-arm, as they stare at the <i>elite</i> of
Yarmouth shop windows, and there is a Broad Row, across which, if
an Adelphi harlequin could not skip from first floor to first
floor, he would get from the manager very significant hints about
his abilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reader cannot fail to have observed the numerical
diversity in the above quotations, as to the total number of the
Rows.&nbsp; The discrepancy probably arose through a compositor,
when engaged upon a Yarmouth publication, transposing two of the
numerals, thus turning the number 145 to 154, and the error
passing unobserved remained uncorrected; and succeeding writers,
instead of drawing inspiration from the fountain-head&mdash;the
Rows themselves, have complacently copied, and so perpetuated the
blunder.&nbsp; This, however, does not explain the number given
as 156.</p>
<p>Considerable allowances must be made for many of the
statements given by the various writers, in consideration of the
length of time that has since elapsed.&nbsp; The onward march of
improvement has become so general, it has penetrated even into
the recesses of these old-world thoroughfares.&nbsp; Although
they remain, as in all probability they will continue to be, the
picturesque, tumble-down Rows of Yarmouth, a &ldquo;Paradise for
painters,&rdquo; as <i>Punch</i> described them, still the signs
of the times are now apparent within their precincts.&nbsp;
Pedestrians are no longer compelled to tread gingerly upon
uncrushed &ldquo;petrified kidneys,&rdquo; when threading their
way through them, but may proceed satisfactorily and pleasantly
along a pathway of concrete or flagstone, and if disposed to
enter them at night, he <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>will discover that nearly all are now
illuminated by gas.&nbsp; When preparation was being made for
these improvements in the year 1884, an official measurement of
eighty-one of the Rows was taken, and the total length of them
was ascertained to be 8,372 yards, or rather more than 4&frac34;
miles.&nbsp; The entire length of the 145 Rows exceeds seven
miles.&nbsp; Within the eighty-one Rows which were measured, the
number of the dwelling-houses was found to be 1,811.</p>
<p>The names of some of the Rows were sufficiently remarkable to
justify Dickens in amusingly referring to them as
&ldquo;Jumber&rsquo;s Row,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mopus&rsquo;s
Row.&rdquo;&nbsp; Known as the Rows were to succeeding
generations all down the ages, by name only, it was no easy
matter to wean the Yarmouthians from the method so familiar to
them and their forefathers, of recognising each Row by its
name.&nbsp; The change from name to number was adopted by the
Corporation in the year 1804, and although a century of years
have since nearly run their course, many of the old inhabitants
still recognise a Row by name, in preference to its number.&nbsp;
The writer has found it a common occurrence for persons, after
long residence in Rows, to be utterly unable to state their
numbers.&nbsp; A woman when asked the number of the Row she lived
in, said, &ldquo;57, but I don&rsquo;t know whether it is the
same number at both ends.&rdquo;&nbsp; Quite recently, &ldquo;Row
161&rdquo; was given to the writer as a place of residence of an
individual.&nbsp; A woman born in Row 21, in 1869, wrote in 1893,
&ldquo;I was born in Row 100, where some houses were pulled down
for Sir E. Lacon&rsquo;s Brewery.&rdquo;&nbsp; An illustration of
a similar character may be given from one of the Register Books
at the Parish Church.&nbsp; In 1840, at their marriage, a couple
were asked their place of residence, and it was given as
&ldquo;Row 171,&rdquo; and they evidently stood uncorrected, as
&ldquo;Row 171&rdquo; was recorded.&nbsp; Still further proofs
may be culled from these Registers, showing the tenacity with
which the old names were cherished.&nbsp; Most of the following
designations have been obtained from entries which were made
within the first four years of Her present Majesty&rsquo;s
reign:&mdash;</p>

<p>In some instances two names were given to the same Row.</p>
<p>Rampart Row no longer exists.&nbsp; The cottages have been
removed and the old rampart wall exposed to view; the space thus
gained has been converted into a carriage way, and the
thoroughfare named Rampart Road.</p>
<p>It has been asked, why are these thoroughfares called
Rows?&nbsp; In Palmer&rsquo;s <i>Notes on Manship</i>, p. 271, we
find the following reply:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Row&rsquo; is
supposed to be derived from <i>rhodio</i>, to walk; or from the
Saxon <i>rowa</i> (a rank); or, which is more probable in the
sense in which it is used in Yarmouth, from the French
<i>rue</i>, a street, or lane.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>YARMOUTH BEACH,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ITS HOLIDAY ASPECTS.</span></h2>
<p>Now for a sudden transition from the ancient to the modern,
from medi&aelig;val shadows to undimmed sunlight, from the
comparatively humdrum stillness and gravity of ordinary daily
life into the midst of vivacious holiday activities, from the
pent-up Rows to the glorious freedom of Yarmouth&rsquo;s
magnificent Marine Drive and unrivalled Beach.&nbsp; Who could
reasonably desire the realisation, in the course of a few brief
moments, of a wider contrast or a change more refreshing?&nbsp;
Where, but in Yarmouth, could such a transition take place in so
short a time, for where, but in the renowned old borough can
<i>such</i> a series of such Rows be found?&nbsp; And where else
can be seen a Beach of such proportions, with its far-reaching
stretches of dry, clean, soft, &ldquo;golden&rdquo; sand, and its
uninterrupted view of the German Ocean, continuous from north to
south, and bounded along the east by the horizon alone?&nbsp;
Measured by miles, both Beach and Marine Drive afford ample scope
for the enjoyment of thousands of visitors of all classes.&nbsp;
Small cause for wonder is it that a veritable army of
recreationists, at least a hundred thousand strong (including
day-trippers), should be attracted thither year by year, it would
be surprising were they not to come.&nbsp; From the Rows to the
Beach we go, with anticipations of pleasure of an altogether
different description, and find amusement in watching for a time
the varied ways in which the present detachment of the
season&rsquo;s welcomed battalions of visitors are disporting
themselves.&nbsp; Let us see what delights on a favourable day in
summer our splendid sands afford!</p>
<p>Proceeding by a convenient wooden gangway laid upon the sand
from the Marine Drive to high water mark, close to the Britannia
Pier, we are at once in the midst of a lively spectacle, people
of all ages and sizes are here, happy in the consciousness of
being able to enjoy themselves in the way their fancy leads
them.&nbsp; Pleasure is the prevailing object on which all minds
are set.&nbsp; Many of the fair sex are quietly seated upon the
accommodating sands, perusing their favourite books, papers, and
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>periodicals, or engaged in some light and fanciful work
whilst quietly noting the ever-changing scene going on around
them.&nbsp; Nursemaids in charge of juveniles are keeping guard
over sundry cast-off shoes and stockings, whilst carefully
watching the youngsters paddling joyously in the foaming
surf.&nbsp; Paterfamilias, too, is in the surf, and provides a
centre of attraction to a number of ladies whose interest,
however, is not in him, but in the young olive branch&mdash;his
very smallest&mdash;whose wriggling extremities he is
endeavouring to bathe in the spreading waves.&nbsp; As his
holiday inexpressibles appear likely to receive more from the sea
than the unwilling child, his better half rushes forward to the
rescue and hastily &ldquo;reefs&rdquo; them.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p24b.jpg">

</a>Bare-legged children in goodly numbers are paddling about and
with shovels and tiny buckets are busily engaged in digging small
docks and trying to fill them with water, others are making sand
pies or erecting buildings in original styles of architecture,
and castles and towers not remarkable for stability.&nbsp; From
the paddlers to the bathers our <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>attention turns.&nbsp; Two young
ladies have emerged from the bathing machines and are bravely
swimming away, whilst the bathing of the other naiads consists in
tightly holding the ropes attached to the machines, and giving a
succession of hysterical jumps that display the intense ugliness
of their dresses.&nbsp; In this ugliness we detect a
device.&nbsp; The main desire of the designer, surely, must have
been to divert the unwelcome attentions of too obtrusive
individuals of the opposite sex.&nbsp; In the distance are the
gentlemen&rsquo;s machines, and near them can be seen a number of
heads dotting the restless waters. <a name="citation25"></a><a
href="#footnote25" class="citation">[25]</a>&nbsp; For lovers of
the sea seeking enjoyment upon, rather than immersion in it, the
boatmen are on the <i>qui vive</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hi, hi, hi, any
more going!&rdquo; shouts one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here you are, sir, a
jolly sail out,&rdquo; says another.&nbsp; Whilst a third, on
business bent, cries, &ldquo;Come along, we&rsquo;re going to
give you a treat, sixpence for a sail, any more
going?&rdquo;&nbsp; We watch the filling and launching of one or
two of the boats, and note the jaunty air and smiling faces of
some adventurers as they go aboard, and have little doubt that
some of their smiles will soon be exchanged for more reflective
countenances.&nbsp; Presently we are invited to have a trip in a
rowing boat, &ldquo;Have a row, sir, nice day for a
row.&rdquo;&nbsp; Numbers at the time are indulging in that
pleasant form of enjoyment.&nbsp; A party of eight are seated in
a rowing boat waiting to be launched, when a little stripling
about seven summers old, bare-legged and brave, seeing their
readiness, tries with all his might to give the boat the impetus
it needs.&nbsp; Some day, his indomitable will and energy will,
we hope, be more amply rewarded.</p>
<p>Watching the return of the sailing boats and the landing of
the passengers is found by many to be interesting, especially
when the sea is inclined to take a mean advantage of those
standing awaiting their turn <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>to land, by unceremoniously bumping
the boat, and causing the whole company simultaneously to lose
their equilibrium and receive a shower of spray.&nbsp; Of course
they laugh as well as their friends on shore, indeed, everybody
regards it as great fun.&nbsp; Turning from the sea to the beach,
we often find a small &ldquo;dock,&rdquo; caused by the incoming
flood or left by the last tide upon the beach.&nbsp; This is a
source of supreme enjoyment to numbers of juveniles.&nbsp; Here,
with perfect safety, paddling is being indulged in.&nbsp; Here
miniature vessels are sailing, and, as from a reservoir, water is
being conveyed in buckets for supplying the various needs of
those actively engaged in raising fortifications, planning
gardens, and making fish ponds.</p>

<p>This central position of the beach being most frequented by
visitors, it is also the chief resort, the happy hunting ground
of the numerous class who have a keen eye to business.&nbsp;
Nearly all of them are vendors of only one kind of article each,
and this peculiarity tends to multiply their numbers, the variety
of merchandise among the whole being considerable.&nbsp; There
are so many&mdash;and some of them are strangers to
Yarmouth&mdash;that, were they not civil, and usually take the
first refusal, persistency with frequency would be an annoyance
little short of a nuisance.&nbsp; Take a seat <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>and your
troubles begin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your chocolate
creams.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Buns, two a penny.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yarmouth rock, penny a box.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Apples,
penny a bag.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hokey Pokey, two a
penny.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nuts or pears&mdash;fine
Williams.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>&ldquo;Lemonade, three-a-pence a
bottle.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pears or grapes, all ripe, buy a nice
bunch of grapes, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Walnuts, eight a penny,
fine walnuts.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Milk, penny a
glass.&rdquo;&nbsp; These and many other solicitations are made
to unfortunate visitors whilst reclining upon the sands or
occupying seats, reading the morning papers, Conservative,
Radical, and Sporting, or engaged in knitting, sewing, or fancy
work of some kind, nursing, chatting, novel reading, or lazily
watching the ever-changing scene on the Beach, or meditatively
listening to the everlasting music of the sea.&nbsp; Fancy the
effect of such a succession of interruptions upon a couple who
had passed the spooning period of life and were intently engaged
in writing, probably letters to their friends, jotting down their
impressions fresh from the sands; before subscribing themselves
as &lsquo;Yours ozoneously, Jim, or Jemima,&rsquo; we can imagine
they would be able to lay much to the charge of these itinerating
traders.</p>

</a>Real fun, that is thoroughly appreciated by all classes, is
supplied when a sailing boat has to be drawn above high water
mark upon the beach.&nbsp; Young and old of both sexes and all
classes willingly lend a helping hand at the long rope, and
merrily runs the boat, responsive to the united pull, to the
destined place.&nbsp; Spooning couples are in profusion upon the
sands.&nbsp; The vicinity of the Beach Concert-ring appears to be
a favoured spot with them.&nbsp; Groups of pleasure seekers are
reclining upon the clean, soft sand in all directions.&nbsp; Some
of them, like children, finding amusement in trifling
things.&nbsp; The most objectionable form of
&ldquo;larking&rdquo; with each other is the throwing handfuls of
sand.&nbsp; Country bumpkins find special delight in this.&nbsp;
Such a Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s ground would not be overlooked by
gipsies; three of the tribe are present with keen eyes for
clients, and a sharp look out for policemen.&nbsp; One of the
gipsies tries to effect a capture, but the desired coin is not
forth-coming.&nbsp; But gipsies have not a monopoly in
fortune-telling.&nbsp; A bronzed peasant from the sunny south is
here, with birds and papers, ready to make <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>any
ninny-hammer giggle at the small charge of one penny.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemens, these Indian birds will take a
planet of your fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next moment, and we find
yet another opportunity of peering into futurity, being invited
to &ldquo;try the Fairy Press for your fortune&rdquo; to be
announced in the form of an Instantaneous Photograph of your
future partner; this also for one penny.&nbsp; Photographers,
without future pretences, of course, are here, and appear to be
in eager demand.&nbsp; Edwins and Harrys, who have already
selected their Angelinas, are prepared to pose placidly with them
by their sides, under the searching scrutiny of the
Photographers&rsquo; lens.&nbsp; At the <i>al fresco</i> concert
a small and select company are informed by the singer, in
connection with his song that his &ldquo;wife was gone where
briny breezes blow, after being married four years and sixteen
months.&rdquo;&nbsp; At an Electric Battery an interested group
are watching a sturdy individual, who declines to cry
&ldquo;peccavi&rdquo; to the evident surprise of the
electrician.&nbsp; The next who submits himself is soon satisfied
with his pennyworth.&nbsp; The open door of the Camera Obscura
invites those who prefer less excitable pleasures to enter within
its calm and retired seclusion, and there see what is to be
seen.&nbsp; The Happy Family is at hand to throw more
entertainment into the morning&rsquo;s programme, and to give a
lesson in social and domestic felicity.&nbsp; Then the familiar
face presents itself, of one who is on excellent terms with
himself, and with all around.&nbsp; Our Beach friend, an
illusionist, has just planted his little table upon the sands,
placed his guinea pig upon it, and is gratified to see the circle
of expectant admirers who immediately gather round.&nbsp; After
widening the circumference of the circle a second time, turning
up his sleeves, etc., he prefaces his usual performance with
&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, I shall have much pleasure in
showing you some entirely new tricks.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before
performing the culminating trick, which is really extremely
clever, he favours the company with what he terms his
&ldquo;shell trick,&rdquo; collecting contributions first from
the outsiders, whom he names &ldquo;the gallery,&rdquo; and next
from those within &ldquo;the stalls.&rdquo;&nbsp; For those
desirous of being told something about their own craniums and
capabilities, there are three Professors ready to enlighten
them.&nbsp; The first we reach is delineating a most
unsatisfactory skull.&nbsp; He is advising the young woman, if
she is in the habit of drinking tea, to give it up, and to drink
Cocoa instead, to eat plenty of fruit, and to take all the
out-door exercise she can, and be in the sunshine as much as
possible.&nbsp; He says, with much frankness, &ldquo;Her head is
a large one; she has little respect for other people, will tell
them what <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>she thinks of them, and will say much more than they
like.&nbsp; She thinks herself as good as other people.&nbsp;
When anything happens she does not like, she will go down in the
dumps, and be like a dying duck in a thunderstorm.&nbsp; She is
not generous, and has not much confidence in herself.&nbsp; She
will be influenced more by love of approbation than by religious
influence.&nbsp; She is inclined to be severe to people, and I
would advise her to keep her monkey down, as when it is up it is
a very warm monkey indeed.&nbsp; She has a keen sense of the
ridiculous, and can appreciate it, and I would advise her to read
Dickens&rsquo; works.&nbsp; She can reason well and criticise
well, and her tongue could go nineteen to the dozen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We find that Palmistry is being practised by the next Professor
upon the hand of a female.&nbsp; We hear him inform her that her
fingers are long; that she does not achieve all that she would
like to achieve; that her thoughts and imaginations are of a
romantic kind; that her character is flexible; that she has a
disposition for a broad circle of friends, and so on.&nbsp; The
seat when vacated, is soon filled by a man.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is
the hand of a mechanic, large, broad, takes a broad grasp.&nbsp;
He would do very well as a Civil Engineer.&nbsp; He does not
confine his thoughts to every-day life.&nbsp; He has a love of
home, and a fondness of seeing the world very broadly.&nbsp; He
likes to know, and he <i>will</i> know; he will stir up the water
till the mud rises but what he will know.&nbsp; He is a type of
man who could command as a general in the Army.&nbsp; In
mercantile life he would succeed in everything he
undertakes.&nbsp; In politics he takes rather a broad
range.&nbsp; He is not an eloquent exponent of his own
thoughts.&nbsp; He has a good memory, can tell a story he has
heard, and add a little to it.&nbsp; Imaginativeness is well
developed in his nature.&nbsp; He has the hand of one that is
tolerably cool; were he a gentleman with nothing in his pocket,
he would push on until he had made a fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; All
this, and more the Professor saw with the aid of a powerful
magnifying glass.&nbsp; The third professor, a lady, is
endeavouring to get an occupant for an empty seat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If any lady be present who doesn&rsquo;t wish to take her
bonnet off, I am as able to read her face as her head; or, if
there are any persons present who would like to have their hands
read, I am quite prepared to do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; How very
accommodating!</p>

<p>All these things are going on within a comparatively small
compass, between the Britannia Tier and the Jetty.&nbsp; And now
without being allured into the &ldquo;Skylark Tea Saloon,&rdquo;
where &ldquo;small parties are catered for on the Sands;&rdquo;
whether small parties of skylarks, or skylarking parties, we <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>were left to
imagine; or, pausing to scan the Roadstead through the telescope
placed in readiness, or indulging in a seat in the weighing
machine, we pass on to a calmer region, where gratifications of a
less exciting character may be enjoyed.&nbsp; For this we had not
to travel far.&nbsp; Passing the boundary line of the Jetty we
instantly find, between that greatly improved structure and the
Wellington Pier, a great transformation scene has taken
place.&nbsp; Loose sand and shingle have given place to a
capacious and beautifully terraced garden artistically laid,
adorned with vases and fountains, and with a bandstand in the
centre.&nbsp; While the young, the healthy and the boisterous may
find the fullest opportunities for thorough enjoyment elsewhere;
here the quiet, the weakly and the meditative may get away from
the madding crowd and calmly indulge in reflection.&nbsp; Between
this garden and the sea, an Esplanade of magnificent proportions
has been made, and provided with sitting accommodation along the
entire length, where Visitors may, free of charge, recline,
facing the sea; and, whilst taking rest, may take in the strains
of sweet operatic music discoursed <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>by the Military Band upon their
instruments; or, while perusing their favourite books, inhale the
fragrance of the flowers, or the ozone from the sea.&nbsp; When
promenading upon this Esplanade, we overheard the remark made by
a Visitor (which is probably often to be heard), &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think Lowestoft is a patch upon this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p33b.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>To lovers of peace and solitude, Yarmouth can hold forth an
inviting hand, and point to its miles of Marine Drive and its
level Beach, with its soft sands, rendered agreeably smooth and
firm by the retreating tide and dried by the sun.&nbsp; Seats and
shelters in abundance have been provided upon the Drive and the
Jetty.&nbsp; A short rest in one of these agreeable shelters will
now be welcome, and, while resting, the visitor will find ample
food for reflection in observing the infinite variety in the <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>appearance
and bearing of the many passers by.&nbsp; One thing is obvious:
there is unmistakable evidence of enjoyment stamped upon them
all.</p>
<p>By the Jetty are numerous Drags, awaiting the time to convey
into the country their complements of passengers.&nbsp; Persons
fond of variety are willing, for a short time, to leave the
attractions of the Beach and Jetty in exchange for a pleasant
drive.&nbsp; A good choice of destinations is given, Caister
Castle, Ormesby Broad, Fritton Lake, Somerleyton Park and
Lowestoft being amongst the number.</p>
<p>As we perambulate our spacious and recently much-improved
Promenade on the Marine Drive, we cannot fail to notice how great
is the supply of vehicles provided for all classes; numerous
well-appointed carriages meet our view; omnibuses, brakes, traps,
bicycles, tricycles, goat chaises, perambulators, Bath chairs,
and donkeys are in readiness for all who desire them.&nbsp; On
the latter, venturesome visitors may feel perfectly safe.</p>
<p>Much more might be said, but we must now close and allow the
second Beach Garden, the Jetty, the two Piers, the Aquarium, the
Tower, the Switchback and Bicycle Railways, and the
Sailors&rsquo; Home Museum to speak for themselves.&nbsp; All we
need remark is that each and all of these have special
attractions that are sought out and enjoyed by multitudes of
delighted Visitors.</p>
<p>The busy scene we have depicted, of life and animation, of
good temper and well-earned enjoyment may be witnessed through
the entire season in propitious weather.&nbsp; The whole
assembled multitude may be divided into two classes, the pleasure
seekers and those who minister to their gratifications.&nbsp;
Were some of the latter more considerate, and less persistent in
their endeavours &ldquo;to make hay while the sun shines,&rdquo;
and bear well in mind the fact that the enjoyment of seaside
visitors (although the bracing air conduces to appetite) does not
altogether consist in eating chocolate, sucking sweets, cracking
nuts, drinking half-pints of milk, consuming penny buns, or
munching &ldquo;beautiful Williams:&rdquo; our lovely and much
resorted-to Beach, attractive as it is, in spite of all these
unnecessary drawbacks, would be more thoroughly enjoyed and
appreciated by the tens of thousands of Visitors who resort to it
year after year.</p>

that tyme beganne to growe in greate strengthe and estimacion,
for it appearethe by the Records in the Tower, that in those
daies there was some controversy between the men of the Synque
Portes of the one parte, and the men of Yarmouth on the other
parte, insomuch as the men of Yarmouthe prevayled in the sea
greatlie agenste the men of the Synque Portes, and did burn and
take and spoyle divers of there shippes, for which the Synque
Portes compleyned to King Edward Second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the year 1545, &ldquo;Warres being betwene England and
France, there were in Yarmouthe Rode two Shippes laden with wheat
to goe for Bolleyn&rdquo; (to Bolougne), &ldquo;for the
King&rsquo;s Maties provisions, and upon Saint Andrews Daye there
came two Frenche Schippes of Warre throughe the Roade and boarded
the said two Englishe Shippes and cutte their cables, and were
carreyenge them away, whereof when tidenge was brought to Mr.
Bailifes in the Church&rdquo; (it being a Saints day, the
Corporation was attending morning service at St. Nicholas&rsquo;
Church).&nbsp; &ldquo;All the whole Townsmen went out and got
there weapons and manned two other Shippes and rescued the said
King&rsquo;s provisions and took six Frenchmen in the prises, and

County of Cambridge, by day or night, to swim or wash, he should,
if under the degree of Bachelor of Arts, for the first offence,
be sharply and severely whipped publicly in the common hall of
the College, and on the next day should be again openly whipped
in the public school where he was, or ought to be, an auditor
before all the auditors, by one of the proctors, or some other
assigned by the Vice-Chancellor; and for the second offence every
such delinquent shall be expelled his college and the University
for ever.&nbsp; But if he should be a Bachelor of Arts, then for
the first offence he should be put in the stocks for a whole day,
in the common hall of his College, and should, before he was
liberated, pay ten shillings towards the Commons of the College,
and for the second offence he should be expelled his College and
the University.&nbsp; And if he should be a Master of Arts, or
Bachelor of Law, physic, or music, or of superior degree, he
should be severely punished, at the judgment and discretion of
the Master of his College, or, in his absence, of the President
and one of the Deans.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cooper&rsquo;s <i>Annals of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
